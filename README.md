# Business Site

The case was to build a page with a form and a accordian.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I approached the case with the help of flexbox and Grid. I then styled it with some special effects on the form button and box-shadow.
